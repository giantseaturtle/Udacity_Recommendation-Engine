# Motivation

This project is following the requirement of Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity to create recommendation engine for IBM Watson Studio platform.

In this project, I will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they will like.

# Required Libaries
This project was written by Python, using Jupyter Notebook, including common packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

# Summary
Generally, this project will explore and analyze the data, and create following recommendation engines:

I. Rank Based Recommendations: First find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions, these are then the articles we might recommend to new users (or anyone depending on what we know about them)

II. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: Look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with, this would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users.

III. Matrix Factorization: Ultilize machine learning to building recommendations, create a matrix decomposition to predict new articles an individual might interact with, and test how well your recommendations are working for engaging users.
